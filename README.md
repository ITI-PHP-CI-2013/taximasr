Taxi Masr. اللى ركبوا التاكسى دة قبلك رأيهم فيه ايه؟؟

*An open-source crowd-sourced mobile-web taxi review service*

Introduction
------------

The application allows users to rate and read information on taxis that they ride. Information include the behavior of the taxi driver (polite or rude), driving style (slow, normal, aggressive) … etc. It’s a way of telling the taxi rider what to expect in her ride, and to optionally allow her to rate her experience with that taxi.

In addition to ratings, a safety measure is also implemented, where the user can optionally let the application send an email to a friend of hers (or her father/husband … etc.) to let him know of her location, what taxi did she take and at what time. This is a safety measure that might help save someone in case of a kidnapping attempt.

On the long term, as more and more crowd-sourced data is collected, a database of taxis in Alexandria (or any other city that this web application is targeting) would be built, leading to valuable information such as best and worst taxis, aggregate statistics on the overall status of taxis in Alexandria and the forward trends for this status, … etc. We could later implement some sort of a reward scheme where the best taxis would be able to obtain tags from the website to demonstrate their ratings.
